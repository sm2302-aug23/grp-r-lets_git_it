# Task 6 ------------------------------------------------------------------
# For task 6, we were curious about how it task 5 would show on a graph.
# So, that could be described as identifying and visualizing the starting  
# integers that produce the longest sequences before reaching 1. And then 
# comparing between the odd and even integers.
